### Snake! (Pt. 2)

The `snake` game has been completed. While there is always room for improvement and surely other features that can be added to the game, it is currently operating like a classic game of snake. Navigating with the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` keys, players can collect as much food that randomly appears on the screen and rack up points. If a collision is made with any of the walls or with the snake's own body... GAME OVER!
