### Coffee Machine

Interact with the terminal for a hot espresso drink. Choose an `espresso`, a `latte`, or a `cappuccino` and enjoy. If you're the maintenance person, then type `report` to view the status of the machines resources and how much money it has made while in operation. If the machine requires servicing, remember to turn it `off` first.
