### Tip Calculator

This is another very simple python app to run in the terminal that will take user input from set prompts and return a calculated 10, 12, or 15 percent tip.

\* _this program assumes valid user input_

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.60
```
