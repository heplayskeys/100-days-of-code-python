### Hirst Turtle Dot Painting

This exercise utilizes the built-in turtle package to design a dot painting like that of Hirst. First, it scans the `image.jpg` file to extract a color palette, then it removes any of the white background colors from the extraction (removing the line to do this will add background -- or close to background -- colors back into the palette). After the colors have been set, it sets up the turtle and gets to drawing.
